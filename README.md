# Primrose

Primrose is a 3D game engine built in Java 11 for the purpose of quick and simple development and prototyping of applications with an extensible engine.

Primrose is designed to be heavily abstracted from the base library, while offering user control to those who seek it.

Primrose is still in an early development stage, but progress is being made towards this goal of high performance, cross platform 3D Graphics and games.

Primrose is, and always will be free to use, and community support is appreciated.
